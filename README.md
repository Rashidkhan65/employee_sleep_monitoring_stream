## Overview
This project implements a **real-time sleep detection system** using computer vision. It monitors a live camera feed (via RTSP) and detects when a personâ€™s
eyes remain closed beyond a threshold, indicating potential sleep. Upon detection, it sends an alert message to a **Kafka topic**, making it suitable
for integration into monitoring systems for workplaces, drivers, or security applications.

## Features
- Real-time eye closure detection using **Dlib facial landmarks**.
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** calculation to detect drowsiness.
- Configurable threshold for sleep detection and consecutive frames.
- Sends **Kafka messages** for integration with alert systems.
- Optional live video display for monitoring.
